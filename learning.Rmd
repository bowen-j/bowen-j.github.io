### Here "*R*" some ways I've incorporated *R* into my classes...

#### Using *R* to build network diagrams (with the `visNetwork` package)

This network was created from the patterns in our class discussion forums in Psychology and Social Media. How fitting that an exchange of ideas takes on an emergent structure that looks so much like a  brain! The different colored arrows represent responses among students in 4 different discussion threads. Feel free to zoom in or drag the various nodes of the network around.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
